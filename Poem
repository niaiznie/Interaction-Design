Your eyes are like the stars at night,
Your eyes shines like a diamond,
Your eyes are as beautiful as the moon rising above the sea,
Your eyes are full of hopes.

He looks with those eyes
those eyes that want
what I do not have. 

Even with those brown eyes of yours,
I can see how colourful those eyes are,
Oh, how beautiful you are.

But with the distance between us,
I can only pray for your well being,
I hope you are happy with your new life.
